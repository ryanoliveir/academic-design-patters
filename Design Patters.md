# Design Patters



__Design Patters__ are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software desing. They
are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring desing problem in your
code.


You can't just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf 
functions or libraries. The patterne is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for
solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement the solution that suits
the realities of your program.


Patters are often with algorithms because both concepets describe typical solutions to some know problems.
While an algorithm always defines the clear set of actions that can achive some goal, a pattern is more 
high-level description of a solution. The code of same pattern applied to two different programs may be
different.

An analogy to a algoritm is a cooking  recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand,
a patters is a more a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order
of implementation is up to you.


# Classification of patterns

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called idioms. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are architectural patterns. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

In addition, all patterns can be categorized by their intent, or purpose. This book covers three main groups of patterns:

- __Creational patterns__ provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- __Structural patterns__ explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- __Behavioral patterns__ take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
